# MovieSelection
 
The  project I did was I made a program that reads in a text file and parses it line by line and then prints out a random movie to watch since deciding on movies to watch has been a problem for me and my girlfriend. This assignment was used so that I could teach myself a language and I chose to teach myself Go.
